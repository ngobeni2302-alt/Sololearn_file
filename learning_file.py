2. Python has a simple syntax which means it's easy to write, read and learn

3. The print() instruction is the easiest way to send a message to the screen or other display device
4. It requires the use of parentheses around the message ( )
5. Make sure that  each message is quoted or it will result in an error, a message the computer can't read!"""

# example2 : run an instruction that will display Hello, World! as the outcome.

"""
6. Although each message must be quoted, numbers aren't always quoted depending on the instruction given
...But we'll dive deeper into numbers as time goes by... today, it was all about learning how to send instructions.
